I gravitate towards videography over photography because it limits interpretation, in that, context is created by the very nature of time elapsing. You can either create a narrative or capture one, conversely it is far more difficult to do so in photographs. Often times, pictures require background knowlege of context, creator intention, etc. Videos much less so, a trait I love exploring when I'm creating content`

There's also nothing like hiking miles of trails to arrive at a destination only a those who have persisted the same path have been. Some people think it's contrary to be both passionate about technology and nature, but in my opinion, it's a necessary balance.`

Big decisions, breakups, fights, anxiety, impatience, grudges and just about anything else seem a little easier to deal with after running up and down the court and having a silent conversation with the hoop.`

Putting on wireless headphones and going in on the workouts is the most zen you can get on a work day.`

            <p>My friend and I enjoy traveling and taking pictures, but weren&#39;t huge fans of taking pictures of ourselves. The solution, for some reason, was to wear a dinosaur suit instead. We&#39;re not sure what other steps led to that conclusion as well. But it did lead to this awesome video.

Give the video time, the sun will come out, believe me, I heard it all when we first arrived at the spot and it was cloudy and cold. I found this place a long time ago while hiking at a nearby area. I knew I&#39;d eventually take my friends here and have a BBQ.</p>
