                        <p>This second post may seem a bit confusing, if not random, so let me put some context before I begin this article. As I previously mentioned in the <a href="/blog/journal/je/je1" className="accent-color accent-hover">previous post</a>, I&#39;ve tried journaling before but would usually abandon it after a couple of post. This is the first post from the last journal I tried to keep. Unfortunately, that journal got as far as two seperate post. Nevertheless, I still like (most of) the post that I wrote for that blog and want to move the content here. This is my attempt at combining the two post I had into this journal. Excuse the abrupt writing style change. Without further ado, here&#39;s "Hello World."</p>
                        <p>My name is Carlo and I’ve just started my journey as an Android Developer. OK, that was really dramatic. I’ve actually already finished my course in Android Development at Udacity (shout-out: great place to learn online at your own pace), but in the grand career scheme of things, I’ve only just taken my first steps. So…</p>
                        <p>Welcome to the inaugural first post where I have no idea what I’m doing and will probably look back at this and say “Why would I write that?” But that’s how it goes when you try new things, and at the end of the day, we should enjoy doing new things. To quote a person that I just looked up on google using the quote I’m about to write… Neale Donald Walsch once said, “Life begins at the end of your comfort zone.” I’ve repeated that to myself whenever I’m about to do something I’ve never done before or try something I’ve no experience doing. Every time, it gives me the courage to try, the permission to fail, and even the state of mind to enjoy the ride (regardless if the experience spectacularly bombs, surprisingly succeeds, or anything in between).</p>

                        <p>This blog will be about my journey as an software developer currently focusing on android development. I’ll discuss pitfalls, pro-tips, anything new I learned, advice I’d give to aspiring developers, and pretty much anything dealing with my growth as a developer. I’ll chronicle the good times and the not so good times, and hopefully, at a minimum, be a better person out of it. Like any awkward transition, I’ll begin by starting the other topic of this blog with a random intro. Why is it that most programmer’s first application is the “Hello World” app? Who started this fad? Why “Hello World” and not “Tacos?”</p>
                        <p>Turns out, the reason why is pretty logical. Most new programmers are going to learn something really simple to keep the concept easy. During the 1970’s there were multiple small test programs, but one program, the one we all know and love, was in the programming book THE C PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE by Brian Kernighan. The book became one of the more popular books to learn how to code at the time, resulting in the adaptation of the “Hello World” program. *The more you know*</p>
