                        <p>A few days ago, I had dinner with my parents for my birthday at a local restaurant. We had just finished ordering and was having a conversation about some passing subject when my mom says “Oh, I want to show you something.” She then proceeds to look through her facebook for a particular post. In the back of my head I was already rolling my eyes because when a sentence like that is combined with a dedicated search through facebook profiles, it usually means she’s trying to play matchmaker. I was another year older and due for another prodding, so I began laughing while she was scrolling through her phone. When she turned her phone, I was surprised. It was a black and white picture of a group of you boys in basketball jerseys. She pointed to a kid near the lower right hand side and asked, “guess who that is.” I looked and thought that the boy’s face looked both familiar and foreign. So I asked who he was, and my mom replied, “that’s your dad!” We both laughed, but I was really surprised. Not that the 12 year old person in the photo was my father, but rather, that my dad was playing basketball.</p>

                        <p>It’s no secret my father isn’t a big sports guy, most people who know him know that’s not his forte. Not that he doesn’t enjoy watching sports (he’s a huge boxing fan), but he’s not the type to participate in those type of activities. He prefers to use his mind rather than his body when it comes to competition; I’ve yet to beat him in a game of chess. I do have one memory of him playing basketball with all my uncles when I was still in high school. We were all warming up and taking our first shots and when it was his turn, the ball didn’t just miss the hoop, it missed the entire back board. So I had to ask him, “why did you stop playing basketball.” He responded by saying that he actually enjoyed it when was young, but an incident occured that made him give it up. He said, “I forgot to do my chores one day, and when I came home, my sister took my basketball and cut it in half.” I was taken aback, though kept my outward expressions normal. He then proceeds to say, “appreciate the things you have here in America and make the most of what you can,” and the moment ends soon after he says that because the waiter comes and drops off our order.</p>
                        <p>Growing up, I knew my dad was really strict. I knew there’s probably more stories in his childhood that probably explain why my childhood was the way it was. But that one was especially sad for me to hear because basketball means a lot to me. And I don’t mean it the way some fans mean it when they say, “Oh, I been a so-and-so fan since, “x” years, I’m a real fan. I love this game.” I mean, I’ve had a long history with the sport of basketball, much of my life really, ever since I put that ball through my first basket. I had no expectations of grandeur, of making the league, and I was actually really lucky to make the freshman team in high school. What I love about basketball is what I call court therapy.</p>

                        <p>Court therapy is leaving it all on the floor. It’s coming to the basketball court pissed because life happens and leaving it a little less angry. It’s the game of basketball forcing you to leave anxiety, doubt, and overthinking because the game demands your attention, requires you confidence to shoot your shot, and the clarity to execute your plays. Court therapy is being upset with someone but still passing it to them because your team isn’t good enough to win the tournament if you don’t work as a team. It’s reprieve from being heart broken without gaining a drinking problem and losing all your money. Basketball mean a lot to me for all those reasons and I wish my pops had that growing up too.</p>
                        <p>Life happens, that’s probably why they call it the beautiful struggle. But you gotta get back up more or less intact when it knocks you down. There’s more than one type of therapy out there and I hope everyone has at least one. But when those times come, you know you can always find me at the local court putting up shots.</p>
