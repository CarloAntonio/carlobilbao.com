            answer: "The goal of this project was to upgrade the client's online presence from a limited, self-made WordPress website to a rich and interactive React website. I also wanted to present the client in the same light he carried himself in the real world: a professional, collected, and experienced photographer and videographer. ",

        {
            question: "How were the goals reached?",
            answer: "The goal of this project was reached by first creating a simple and clean layout. The front page comes across like a business card that plays a video giving off an aura of professionalism. The front page also immediately greets the visitor with all of the client's highlighted work, tabbed to present content to the visitor's interest.",
        },
        {
            question: "How were goals set?",
            answer: "The client and I set goals over drinks at a local coffee shop. I asked what he wanted to get out of updating his website and if it was worth upgrading his then-smaller WordPress website. We highlighted three main goals: cleaner design, highlight of previous projects, and presenting a professional look.",

        {
            question: "What are some technologies used on this project?",
            answer: `The client's website uses the usual technologies for website creation, namely HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The website also uses the React Library + Associated React Libraries that bring it to Framework status, to provide a performance boost and "lazy-loads" seldom used links for a slight performance boost.`,
